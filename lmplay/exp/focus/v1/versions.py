#Much simpler thing here. If scaling is really important than allowing it to float to a good value is possibly a good thing.
#A minor improvement at the very beginning of training but it doesn't look like it lasts.
# Didn't run it long since it isn't worth the cost of not being able to use the optimized pytorch version
